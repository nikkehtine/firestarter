Small Firefox config to disable most of the junk and slightly improve privacy and user experience

This is a very minimal config, so it should be compatible with all modern Firefox versions and is unlikely to get broken by updates.

😌 **Want freedom from the junk and true peace of mind?** Consider using [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) instead to save yourself headaches.

## Tweaks

### UI
-   The tab close button is hidden by default and visible on hover
-   You can enable always showing the close button on active tabs
-   The left side separator on the tab bar has been removed
-   The extra padding on the left on unmaximized windows is gone

## Screenshots

> Will be added later
